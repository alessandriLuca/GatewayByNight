This Datapack is an addon for Gateway to Eternity 1.18.2 https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gateways-to-eternity/files/4023734
With this Datapack every night every 300 seconds will spawn randomly a Gateway. 

You can modify the Seconds changing the value 300 in the file GatewayByNight/data/gte/functions/main.mcfunction to whatever time you prefer. You can change the Gateway modifying the function GatewayByNight/data/gte/functions/ff2.mcfunction changing the gateways:creeper_gate.
You can add here other gateway and also change their chance. 

Each gateway chance is specified by the value gte:random. 

TO add a probability add another file or modify the existing files in 
GatewayByNight/data/gte/predicates/random* . Enjoy the new frontier of raids!
